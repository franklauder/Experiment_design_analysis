# Data Review

Weâ€™ll first examine the energy design b structure

```{python}


energy_design_b.info()

```



```{python}

energy_design_b.head()


```



```{python}


energy_design_b.Fuel_Source.value_counts()


```



```{python}



energy_design_b.Geographical_Region.value_counts()


```


```{python}


energy_design_b.groupby(['Geographical_Region', 'Fuel_Source']).count()


```


# Exploratory Data Anapysis

```{python}


mean=energy_design_b.CO2_Emissions.mean()
median=energy_design_b.CO2_Emissions.median()



```


## Sharpio-Wilk Test for Normality



```{python}


from scipy.stats import shapiro
import scipy.stats as stats


```


Null Hypothesis: The distribution of CO2 Emissions is normally distributed

Alternative Hypothesis: The distribution of CO2 Emissions is not normally distributed.

Significance level (alpha): .05


```{python}




alpha=0.05
stat,p=shapiro(energy_design_b['CO2_Emissions'])


```



## CO2 Emissions by Fuel Source


```{python}





```



```{python}





```
